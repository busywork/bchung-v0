## Overview

This project integrates hyperlocal weather data found on Dark Sky into a web application.

<br />

On the initial load, the application will attempt to request geolocation information. End users will
also have the option to enter the desired location (e.g. city or ZIP code) to retrieve current, hourly,
and daily weather forecasts.

## Tech Stack

To keep configuration simple, this application was created with the create-react-app tool. This tool
generates a new React project using a pre-configured webpack build for development, removing the need
to configure and maintain complex build pipelines. React libraries, like react-bootstrap and styled-components,
are also incorporated to manage styling. For example, this web application is deployed through Firebase
Hosting.

## Highlights

### Firebase

Firebase is an application development platform that provides developers with a suite of tools and services
that help them develop quality apps and grow their user base. The platform allows developers to focus
on the application experience itself by offering services such as user authentication, messaging, real-time
database, cloud functions, and hosting. This project utilizes cloud functions to handle weather data
requests and is hosted through Firebase Hosting.

<br />

Cloud Functions for Firebase is a service that integrates back-end code written in JavaScript to other
Firebase services and runs on Google's Cloud infrastructure, making it serverless. The back-end code
can be set up to execute directly through HTTP requests or events triggered by another Firebase service.
This application calls the Dark Sky API directly via a cloud function triggered by an HTTP request.

<br />

```
exports.darksky = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  return axios
    .get(`${url}${req.query.lat},${req.query.lng}?exclude=minutely`)
    .then(response => res.send(response.data))
    .catch(err =>
      res.status(500).json({
        error: err,
      })
    );
});
```

<br />

Firebase Hosting integrates Cloud Functions and other serverless services to offer a fully managed, autoscaling,
and secure environment. It is also great at delivering static assets, such as HTML, CSS, JS, etc., through
a global content delivery network (CDN).

### Styled-Components

There are many approaches to styling components of a React application. Common solutions include CSS
modules (CSS-in-CSS), utility-first CSS libraries (such as Tailwind CSS), and CSS-in-JS, where JavaScript
is used to apply styles.

<br />

Styled-components is a library built for React that defines itself as a CSS-in-JS tool that enables developers
to create components and attach various styles to them using ES6-tagged template literals. This means
that CSS selectors are scoped only to their components, which makes them easier to locate and edit.

<br />
Styled-components support theming through the use of a wrapper component called `<ThemeProvider>`. The component
takes in theme properties and passes it to all of its child components via the context API. For example, this
project enables light vs. dark mode viewing via the use of theming in styled-components.

<br />

```
const darkMode = useDarkMode();
const mode = !darkMode.value ? theme.light : theme.dark;

<ThemeProvider theme={mode}>
  <Components />
</ThemeProvider>
```

## Takeaways

This was my first project using the create-react-app tool, and I was pleasantly surprised at how effortless
it was to make the application work. The create-react-app tool allowed me to jump straight into coding
instead of spending time configuring webpack and other build tools.

<br />

Firebase offers developers the building blocks they need to build a full-stack application and the available
documentation makes the platform a breeze to work with. I initially ran into some hiccups when setting
up Cloud Functions by Firebase, but once it was properly set up and deployed, the service proved to be
fast and reliable, with very little maintenance required. I recommend using this platform for quick prototyping
or building out microservices.
